    <h2>Web Sites – Similar sites to your site, re: similar business nature </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://simbacom.net/" target="_blank">Simbacom.net</a></li>
        <p>I picked this website as a sample of how good my page should look like. It's responsive, and animations are smooth and nice. This is a quality of the page I was looking and aiming for.</p>
        <li><a href="http://www.pcdoctor.ca/" target="_blank">PcDoctor.ca</a></li>
        <p>I chose this website as a great example on how no to create web pages. To be honest, this one of the most terrible designs that I have ever seen(early-late 2000's doesn't count)</p>
        <li><a href="http://thehackery.ca/" target="_blank">TheHackery.ca</a></li>
        <p>Abother terrible website I have found while I was looking for inspiration, for my website. Again I have found only the example of how I SHOULD NEVER DO.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://all-free-download.com/free-website-templates" target="_blank">Free web site tamplates</a></li>
        <p>I have used this one to find a good loking header with high resolution. But you also can find here a lot of free templates, if you stuck on coming up with the design part.</p>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a></li>
        <p>I've used this one to download three videos I have on <a href="quick-fix.html">Quick Fix</a> page. I know how to embed the youtube video code, however I feel that the default design of html video player fits my page more, than the youtube one.</p>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.ca/" target="_blank">Google</a></li>
        <p>Google is the best friend of any developer. You can find everything on it. I used google for social-pages icons, fonts, and also retrieving pictures for my <a href="index.html">Home Page.</a></p>
